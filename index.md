# Lucy Elen learns robotics 

We started by asking Twitter for some advice:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Advice needed!<br><br>My 12 yr old niece told me she wants to get involved in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/robotics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#robotics</a> (‚ù§Ô∏è).

Great introduction to electronics and programming. 

- Start your journey with Microsoft MakeCode block-based or Javascript programming. 
- Then, you can use the same board to try [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython), with the Python interpreter running right on the Express. 
- As you progress, you can advance to using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software), which has full support of all the hardware down to the low level, so you can make powerful projects.
- You can even use [code.org](https://code.org/) (the site Dimitris showed us) CS Discoveries to learn all about coding right in your browser!
- Lot's of [great learning materials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

- Add-on to Circuit Playground Express
- lets you #MakeRobotFriend using CircuitPython, MakeCode (coming soon), or Arduino.
- It complements & extends the Circuit Playground so you can still use all the goodies on the CPX, but now you have a robotics playground as well.
- Bolt on your Circuit Playground using the included stand-off bolts and start controlling motors, servos, solenoids. 
- You also get **signal pins**, **capacitive touch sensors**, a **NeoPixel driver** and **amplified speaker output**. 
- Crickit [projects](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/crickit)

Firstly this is SO CUTE! and a crowdfunded project 

**Details**

The world‚Äôs first **Artificial Intelligence enabled cardboard robot** that you build yourself.

Smartibot **works with your smartphone**, meaning you can use your mobile as a remote control, or by attaching it to your robot, as it‚Äôs brain.  

- The Smartibot app **contains a powerful A.I.** called YOLO which can recognise objects Smartibot sees such as people, cars, dogs and bicycles. 

- Without any programming you can tell your robot to follow you around with a cup of tea, chase your dog or your cat out of your bedroom or even follow your toy car.

### [Crafty Robot](http://thecraftyrobot.net/wp/)

The Crafty Robot is a battery free moving paper robot and the basis for infinite robot creations of your own invention

- Download Free Templates to use with your Fizzbit. Turn your robot into a unicorn, or a zombie, or a pug! All you need is a standard printer, some card, scissors and glue
- If you‚Äôve got access to a 3D printer download [STLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) of our designs from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

Marty is a fully programmable robot, designed to give kids a fun and hands-on introduction to coding and robotics. Marty is also an expandable robot, perfect for makers and educators.

- Marty is Wi-Fi enabled and with **nine individually controllable servo motors**. 

- You can use our app to remote control Marty, and add a bunch of sensors to react to the environment.

- You can program Marty using **Scratch**, a beginner friendly coding language, and then advance on to **Python**, **Javascript** and even **ROS**.

- Designed to be customisable robot with 3D printed parts, Marty is also completely upgradeable ‚Äî you can even add a Raspberry Pi and a camera to Marty's head!
